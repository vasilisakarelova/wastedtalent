Description: 

You never know who you’re going to meet on the first day of school. Sometimes, you can end up being introduced to one of the best friends you’ll ever know. That was the case for Clemens and Philipp—otherwise known as Milky Chance. The Kassel, Germany duo met in an “Advanced Music Course” at the start of eleventh grade, and they creatively gelled right off the bat.
“On that first day, you’re looking around the classroom trying to see who’s cool and who’s not,” laughs Clemens. “We clicked though. It didn’t take long at all for us to notice that we got along great.”
 They got along so great that they played in a local band until graduation. Even though the group disbanded when their drummer left Kassel, Clemens and Philipp kept on making music. Weaving together elegant electronic production with acoustic guitars and lilting, lush vocals, they harnessed a style unequivocally their own.
Clemens put it best, “Think of it as the singer-songwriter spirit mixed with electronic beats. Somehow, it’s always a little bit melancholy, but there’s a positive spin. You can dance to most of it too! Melancholy is something that I carry within me. I write the best songs when this mood catches me.”
In order to capture that, the boys built a tiny studio in the quiet house Clemens grew up in. Over the course of two weeks in 2013, they cut their full-length debut, Sadnecessary, on a minimalist setup, spending hours getting the settings just right. They didn’t need anything more than a rudimentary interface, microphone, and computer. That’s why Sadnecessary sizzles so much.
“There was never a plan,” Clemens goes on. “We only played two shows before we decided to make the album. We never bought expensive studio equipment or even hired a producer. We did what we wanted to and what felt good at the moment. We just wanted to record our music. We never thought it would go further than that.”
However, it went a lot further than that. After cutting the tracks, Clemens and Philipp uploaded the first single “Stolen Dance” to YouTube. With its bright handclaps, plaintive acoustic guitars, and his own gravelly smooth delivery,
the song became a viral sensation, eventually racking up over 30 million-plus YouTube views and made them the “most blogged about act” on Hype Machine for that month.
Now, songs like “Down By The River” flow between poetic musing and delightfully danceable grooves. Clemens remains honest at every turn though. “There is actually a personal story behind ‘Down By The River’,”
Ultimately, because of that emotional expanse, these songs will resonate loudly with listeners everywhere. Clemens leaves off, “At the end of the day, we’re most happy when people discover our music for themselves and have fun at one of our concerts. It’s just great when they listen to a song and connect it to a personal experience. That’s the most amazing thing, and we’d love to encourage that.”

Main-text: 

After   worldwide   success   with   their   debut   "Sadnecessary",   Milky   Chance   is   back   with   a   new   album. "Blossom" carefully expands the Milky Chance sound and presents a band at the peak of their creative power. 
<br>
Let's start with the good ol’ chin-stroking question: how does the story go? It was high school, just before grad-uation. Sure, we were cool dudes, of course. But seriously, disregarding all the heroic stories, the Jacob Grimm School in Kassel was probably no different to any other. Over-achievers kept their noses firmly in the books, dreamers pined over the school beauty, and in the evenings you'd take your cheap drinks on a date to see the local student band. Everyone was preparing themselves for life in their own way.
<br>
Of course, there was a decisive difference at Jacob Grimm. While most student bands never even made it to the next city, Clemens Rehbein and Philipp Dausch became international pop stars. You read that correctly. The two school friends wrote and produced a global hit album, seemingly “on the side”, while they were at the Jacob Grimm School, a dedicated senior high school in Kassel, North Hessen, Germany. They still graduated.
<br>
Two high school graduates from a West German city managed, with what appears to be playful ease, precisely what generations of German pop artists have been desperately trying to achieve: international relevance, success in the USA, sold out tours, the whole shebang. So what happened?
<br>
To answer this question, we have to dig a little deeper. After middle school, previously-unacquainted Clemens Rehbein   and   Philipp   Dausch   switched   to   the   aforementioned   Jacob   Grimm   School   and   began   an   advanced course focusing on music. In the following months, Dausch and Rehbein played together in a band and bought a bus with friends, which they used to busk all around Europe. Most importantly, they met at Dausch's apartment in the after school hours to record some of the songs that Rehbein had been writing for a while.
<br>
In 2012, their last year of high school, they uploaded one of the songs to YouTube, where it gradually generating hundreds of thousands of views. Milky Chance, as Rehbein and Dausch were meanwhile known, started their own record label, pooled money from their circle of friends, got into debt, and released their debut album "Sad-necessary" on May 31, 2013. First, not much happened. It may always have stayed a charming, underground, self-realization campaign by a group of high school graduates from Kassel. 
<br>
But it didn’t. Hidden at the end of the album was one song of the kind that many won't manage in the course of their entire career. "Stolen Dance" is a playful, folk-pop meditation carried by gently-plucked beats. It's about heartache and the transience of things. The song has a swinging, gentle groove and is dominated by the yearning expansiveness of Clemens Rehbein's voice – it's the Milky Chance sound. And this song, this first single, took on a life of its own alongside the album release. There's not enough space to list the almost unbelievable amount of records Milky Chance broke with "Stolen Dance". Among other things, the song has been viewed on You-Tube over 300 million times, placed in the charts of nearly all pop countries, sold two million units in the US alone, and sold almost four million singles in total. Keep in mind that all of this was completely self-organized. Without any kind of corporate backing, the DIY project   of   two   high   school   graduates   from   Kassel   became   a   global   pop   phenomenon.   Rehbein   and   Dausch toured the USA for months on end. They played at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater, were guests on late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel, received an "Echo" award back home in Germany, toured through half the world,   went   gold   with   the   album   "Sadnecessary"   and   the   singles   "Down   By  The   River"   and   "Flashed   Junk Mind", and had stars like Jessica Alba and Miley Cyrus publicly proclaim themselves as fans.In October 2016, the pair finally took a break. Two months in Kassel, family, friends, everyday life, and, of course, the question: what exactly happened? Right now, Rehbein and Dausch are still only in their early 20s, 
but they've tasted blood and never wanted to do anything except music anyway. Slowly, they needed to take the next step, wipe their mouths and continue. Not least because it would be wrong to reduce this band to "Stolen Dance".This puts the classic at centre stage, an eternal cliché of pop music, which, unlike many others, is also true. You have a whole lifetime for the first album, but a year at most for the second. There was no old material to fall back on. There were a few ideas and pieces that came about during their three crazy superstar years, but the new and second Milky Chance album "Blossom" was essentially made from scratch. Rehbein   and   Dausch's   methodology   stayed   basically   the   same.   Clemens   wrote   the   songs,   showed   them   to Philipp, he created a few beats, came up with sounds and samples, and then they continued working on it to-gether. "When we made the first demos, our vision was to stay with our tried and tested style, but take a bit more of a handcrafted approach", says Dausch, which means more of their own samples, more "real instruments", more space. The Houdini trick "Sadnecessary" owed itself to liberalized production means thanks to the Inter-net, and increased technical possibilities. They needed nothing more than a MacBook, a guitar and an Internet connection. It was different now. They met up with producer Tobias Kuhn in April 2016 after producing twelve demos at Dausch's house since February of the same year. Kuhn has written German indie history with his own projects and worked with big pop artists on their music. Since Kuhn was familiar with both sides, he was the ideal man for "Blossom"."You have this cliché in your head that the producer will come and say 'This part doesn't work, we'll take it out, do it like this instead'", says Philipp Dausch. "It wasn't like that with Tobi. He's a very sensitive guy who also engaged with us as people, and really picked up on what was important to us and what wasn't". This was a first for Milky Chance, as they'd always done everything on their own. To now, at such an important point, hand over responsibility, even for content, was something that had to be learned. However, the Kuhn/Milky Chance pairing proved to be a good one, especially when the direction became clear. "Essentially, the task was to gently transfer the basic vibe of the first album onto a wider chassis", says Rehbein. "As a matter of fact, we come from making music with instruments, there's a bit more of that in this album", he adds. Just like before, Milky Chance take the stage as a three-piece, which, aside from Rehbein and Dausch, includes guitarist Antonio Greger. And this component, the music’s feasibility in a live context, was consistently considered from the very beginning.Thus, an album was created that gently expands the Milky Chance sound while staying true to the basic spirit of the music. In the town of Rothenburg, Milky Chance met with Tobias Kuhn at the Toolhouse Studio time and again throughout the whole year. In between, they played the odd concert at a festival, tested the songs in front of an audience, and carried the spirit of these performances into the studio. A more organic approach was devel-oped than the first time around. Milky Chance relied on their gut feeling, letting things and ideas just happen. "There was no conceptual framework for 'Blossom', we approached the album song by song", says Rehbein. "We had faith that the whole thing would make sense in the end, because all of it is us and the songs were creat-ed in a particular phase".It worked! "Blossom" is unmistakably Milky Chance, only an advanced version. "Ego" begins with an extreme-ly smooth, gently bouncing 80s keyboard, but then quickly finds itself in a typical Dausch groove. Because that's what's special about this band – they had their own sound from the start. This comfortably-swinging relax-
ing element, paired with the streetwise, scratchy voice of Clemens Rehbein also permeates every note of the song "Blossom". It's music that doesn't see the sky as a limit, and is grounded at the same time.The first single is carried by a unique guitar groove as only this band possesses. With "Cocoon", Milky Chance succeed at international pop, combining reggae, house, flamenco, pop, singer songwriter and folk. Sometimes they're reminiscent of Manu Chao, you can hear a little Jack Johnson, but the music is always principally one thing: Milky Chance. Born of a deep organic warmth and love. Because songs such as "Cold Blue Rain" always have a dreamy element, are minimalistic in the choice of their means, but are in effect spatially all-consuming. This, of course, is due to the fact that Milky Chance rely on the power of the composition, such as in "Losing You", and also in the voice of Clemens Rehbein. The singer carries "Blossom" and gives the piece an ingenious moment. Then, Rehbein sings "Bad Things" over a house beat in a duet with the English singer Izzy Bizu, who brings another style to the album. Her voice permeates as if from a distant fairy tale land, filling our hearts with yearning and the belief that everything will be alright in the end.Last but not least, "Blossom" is carried by a spirit of deceleration, the realization that sometimes, only the view to and from the outside helps. You could say it's escapism, but most of all, Milky Chance transport a gravity-defying pop-lightness that is not only rare in Germany, but unheard of. So the question of all questions is still: how the hell did such a thing happen in Kassel?"Kassel is the place where we've learned to not get lost", says Rehbein. After the successes, extensive tours and countless human encounters, this is where they can relax and recharge their strength to continue, to focus on the essential, stay grounded. "Three months of touring the US feels like five years", says Dausch. "After that whole spectacle, Kassel is where we find our footing again with our family and friends."They can enjoy the peace and quiet for a few more weeks, and then it's "crunch time", as they say, and they’re looking forward to it! Because that's what's special about Milky Chance: "The circumstances and conditions have changed, but we, as people, have not".
