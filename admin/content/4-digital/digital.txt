Imagine a world where you, as a creator, can consistently get paid for your work with clarity. For each song you write, recording you make, and video you film, it is simple to understand and collect
the mo- ney you’ve earned. Enrolling in countless services and managing them all while creating is inefficient. Between hunting down fractions of dollars that you are owed, to the actual splitting the sum of those earnings every recurring payment, getting paid in full as a creator is incredibly overcomplicated. We’re here to help.
Stem tracks and organizes revenue streams for artists and their teams, giving a clear picture of ear- nings at all times and ensuring everyone involved in the creative process gets paid. No more juggling earnings statements from different services and not knowing when your next payment, no more split- ting each payment manually and no more chasing your collaborators to pay you. With Stem, you can upload content, manage contracts, track revenue
and share earnings. So keep filming, playing, writing and recording.
